Sentence Completion Strategy 3
Strategy: Watch for key words—although signals contrast—the blanks should be opposites. Notice that a key word is “stubbornness,” which implies that the first blank is positive.
2. C, E 
Sentence Completion Strategy 3
Strategy: Watch for key words. “In spite of ” shows an opposite situation. Look for opposites in 
the choices.
3. C, F 
Sentence Completion Strategy 3
Strategy: Watch for key words. “Moreover” is a key word adding to the already negative situation about the composer.
4. C, E, H 
Sentence Completion Strategy 3, 4
Strategy: Watch for key words. Choices C, E, and H are correct. Look at the second blank first. Because of the key words Crusty and egotistical, it would appear that Choice E, the word irascible, meaning hot-tempered, would fit the second blank. And since there were so many things he had as described in the first sentence, Choice H, purveyor (one who spreads things throughout), would be a good fit. Because of the word ostentatious (showy), in the second sentence, you can see that Choice C, flamboyant (showy) would fit the first blank.

Reading Comprehension Strategy 1, 5
Since the fish and shellfish become toxic (line 6), it can be inferred that they must eat the plankton, which could only be small animals or plants. Choice A is incorrect because “coastal plankton” is distinguished in the sentence from “fishes and shellfish.” Choice D is incorrect because fish do not live on land, and it is assumed the situation takes place in water (see lines 1 and 3). Choices C and E are incor rect because it is unlikely that fish and shellfish would eat sand deposits or glacier or rock formations— they would eat plants or smaller animals.
