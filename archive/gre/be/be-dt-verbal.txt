Questions 7—9 are based on the following passage. 
James's first novels used conventional nar- 
rative techniques: explicit characterization, 
action that related events in distinctly phased 
line sequences, settings firmly outlined and 
(5) specifically described. But this method grad- 
ually gave way to a subtler, more deliberate, 
more diffuse style of accumulation of 
minutely discriminated details whose total 
significance the reader can grasp only by 
(10) constant attention and sensitive inference. 
His later novels play down scenes of abrupt 
and prominent action, and do not so much 
offer a succession of sharp shocks as slow 
piecemeal additions of perception. The cur- 
(15) tain is not suddenly drawn back from 
shrouded things, but is slowly moved away. 
Such a technique is suited to James's essential 
subject, which is not human action itself but 
the states of mind that produce and are pro- 
(20) duced by human actions and interactions. 
James was less interested in what characters 
do, than in the moral and psychological 
antecedents, realizations, and consequences 


which attend their doings. This is why he 
(25) more often speaks of "cases" than of actions. 
His stories, therefore, grow more and more 
lengthy while the actions they relate grow 
simpler and less visible; not because they are 
crammed with adventitious and secondary 
(30) events, digressive relief, or supernumerary 
characters, as overstuffed novels of action 
are; but because he presents in such exhaus- 
tive detail every nuance of his situation. 
Commonly the interest of a novel is in the 
(35) variety and excitement of visible actions 
building up to a climactic event which will 
settle the outward destinies of characters 
with storybook promise of permanence. A 
James novel, however, possesses its character- 
(40) istic interest in carrying the reader through a 
rich analysis of the mental adjustments Of 
characters to the realities of their personal 
situations as they are slowly revealed to them 
through exploration and chance discovery.

Questions 10—11 are based on the following passage. 
According to the theory of plate tectonics, 
the lithosphere (earth's relatively hard and 
solid outer layer consisting of the crust and 
Line part of the underlying mantle) is divided 
(5) into a few dozen plates that vary in and 


shape; in general, these plates move in rela- 
tion to one another. They move away from 
one another at a mid-ocean ridge, a long 
chain of sub-oceanic mountains that forms a 
(10) boundary between plates. At a mid-ocean 
ridge, new lithospheric material in the form 
of hot magma pushes up from the 
interior. The injection of this new lithos- 
pheric material from below causes the phe- 
(15) nomenon known as sea-floor spreading. 
</p><p>Given that the earth is not expanding in 
size to any appreciable degree, how can 
"new" lithosphere be created at a mid-ocean 
ridge? For new lithosphere to come into 
(20) being in one region, an equal amount of 
lithospheric material must be destroyed 
somewhere else. This destruction takes place 
at a boundary between plates called a sub- 
duction zone. At a subduction zone, one 
(25) plate is pushed down under another into the 
red-hot mantle, where over a span of mil- 
lions of years it is absorbed into the mantle. 
10. According to the passage, a mid-ocean ridge 
differs from a subduction zone in that 
@ it marks the boundary line between neigh- 
boring plates 
@ only the former is located on the ocean 
floor 
O it is a site for the emergence of new lithos- 
pheric material 
@ the former periodically disrupts the earth's 
geomagnetic field

rather than lithospheric creation

mountain ridge 
O the earth's total mass is altered 
@ it reverses its magnetic polarity

Questions 17—18 are based on the following passage. 
The stability that had marked the Iroquois 
Confederacy's generally pro-British position 
was shattered with the overthrow of James Il 
Line in 1688, the colonial uprisings that followed 
(5) in Massachusetts, New York, and Maryland, 
and the commencement of King 
War against Inuis XIV of France. The 
increasing French threat to English hege- 
mony in the interior of North America was 
(10) signalized by French-led or French-inspired 
attacks on the Iroquois and on outlying 
colonial settlements in New York and New 
England. One high point of the Iroquois 
response was the spectacular raid of August 5, 1689, in which the Iroquois virtually 
wiped out the French village of Lachine, just 
outside Montreal. A counter-raid by the

French on the English village of Schenectady 
in March 1690 instilled an appropriate

Iroquois allies. 
</p><p>Tne Iroquois position at the end of the 
war, which was formalized by treaties made 
during the summer of 1701 with the British 
(25) and the French, and which was maintained 
throughout most of the eighteenth century, 
was one of "aggressive neutrality" between 
the two competing European powers. Under 
the new system the Iroquois initiated a peace 
(30) policy toward the "far Indians," tightened 
their control over the nearby tribes, and 
induced both English and French to support 
their neutrality toward the European powers 
by appropriate gifts and concessions.

French 
@ disprove the charges of barbarism made 
against the Indian nations 
O expose the French governments exploita- 
tion of the Iroquois balance of power

would the author be LEAST likely to agree? 
@ The Iroquois were able to respond effec- 
tively to French acts of aggression. 
@ James Ilk removal from the throne pre- 
ceded the outbreak of dissension among 
the colonies.

Questions 19—20 are based on the following passage. 
A recent assessment of the status of global 
amphibian populations identified habitat 
loss as the single greatest identifiable factor 
contributing to amphibian declines. Habitat 
(5) loss primarily results from the residential, 
agricultural, arboricultural, or recreational 
development of an area. 
</p><p>Anthropogenic conversion of land has 
significant reductions in the wetland,

require for their survival. Outright habitat

amphibians, but habitat degradation, or the 
general decline in the health of a habitat, 
(15) often from environmental contamina- 
tion, the introduction of exotic invasive 
species, or a reduction in required resources 
within a habitat, and similarly affects 
amphibians. Likewise, habitat fragmentation 
(20) (the disruption or fragmentation of habitat 
into discontinuous or isolated remnants of 
viable habitat) emerges from isolated patches 
of habitat loss and can often have delayed 
effects on animal populations. 
19. Which of the following statements about 
habitat loss is supported by the passage? 
@ The role of habitat loss in the decline 
of global amphibian populations is the 
subject of current evaluation. 
@ Outright habitat loss causes less damage to 
amphibian populations than either habitat 
degradation or habitat fragmentation. 
@ Introducing non-native species to an area 
may prove detrimental to the native 
animal populations. 
20. In the course of the passage, the author does 
all of the following EXCEPT 
@ define a term 
@ cite an authority 
O state a probability 
O qualify a statement 
@ make an assertion

Answers
1. (C), (D) Both <i>apt</i> and <i>prone</i> have several meanings. <i>Apt</i>, for example, can 
mean appropriate, as in an apt remark, or it can mean unusually quick and 
intelligent, as in an apt pupil. <i>Prone</i> can mean prostrate; it can also mean 
having a downward slope. Here both apt and <i>prone</i> are used in the sense of 
inclined or liable. 
Note the use of <i>indeed</i> to both confirm and emphasize the preceding state- 
ment. Not only do many of us try to rewrite our lives, but we are almost uni- 
versally inclined to do so. 
2. (D), (F) <i>Far</i> Fom is a contrast signal. It indicates that you are looking for an 
antonym for <i>condemn</i>. The critics do not condemn Warhol for what seems to 
be superficiality and commercialism. Instead, they <i>extol</i> or <i>hail</i> him for having 
captured the superficial, commercial nature of American culture during the 
1970s. 
Note that <i>hail</i> in this context is synonymous with acclaim or approve 
enthusiastically (secondary meaning). 
3. (B), (F) By definition, embezzlers are inclined to fraud. By definition, trick- 
sters are inclined to trickery, that is, to chicanery or artifice. Here artifice 
means subtle but base deception, not skill or ingenuity. 
4. (B), (E) <i>Paradoxically</i> inherently signals a contrast. It indicates that some- 
thing unexpected and unwanted has occurred. An admonition or warning 
intended to reform a spendthrift failed to have the desired result. Instead, it 
<i>reinforced</i> his profligate behavior, <i>confirming</i> or strengthening <i>him</i> in his 
wasteful habits. 
5. (A), (B) You are looking for an antonym for <i>outspoken</i> (frank and unreserved 
in speech). To be <i>reserved</i> is to be restrained or reticent in manner. To be <i>dis</i>- 
creet is to be judicious in conduct or speech. 
6. (D), (F) The key word here is <i>circuitousness</i>. The writer here is developing an 
analogy between the way lawyers drive their cars and the way they build or 
construct their legal arguments. Thus, someone known for choosing cir- 
cuitous (roundabout; twisty) routes might also be known for coming up with 
<i>devious</i> (tricky; oblique) or <i>indirect</i> (roundabout; not direct) arguments. 
7. (C) The author states that the later novels of James play down prominent 
action. Thus, they lack <i>overtly</i> dramatic incident. the author goes on 
to state that James's novels <i>do</i> possess interest; they carry the reader through "a 
rich analysis of the mental adjustments of the characters to the realities of 
their personal situations." It is this implicitly dramatic psychological revela- 
tion that sustains the reader's interest.

Question A is unanswerable on the basis of the passage. It is evident that 
James wrote psychological novels; it is nowhere stated that he originated the 
genre. 
Question B is unanswerable on the basis of the passage. Although conven- 
tional narrative technique relates in distinctly sequences," 
clearly separating them, it does not necessarily recount action in <i>strictly</i> 
chronological order. 
Question D is unanswerable on the basis of the passage. The passage does 
not deal with the public's reaction to James. 
Question E is unanswerable on the basis of the passage. The passage talks 
of qualities in James a novelist in terms of their being <i>characteristic</i>, not in 
terms of their making him <i>unique</i> 
8. (C) In the third sentence the author describes James's later novel as offering 
"slow piecemeal additions of perception." To clarify the process, he goes on in 
sentence four to paint a picture in words, using figurative language. No literal 
curtain is drawn away here; however, the image of a curtain being slowly 
drawn away helps the reader develop a feeling for James's method of psycho- 
logical revelation. 
9. (D) The word "attend" here is used in the sense of "to accompany or 
as a concurrent circumstance or result." People's actions inevitably involve 
moral and psychological realizations and consequences; they go with the terri- 
tory, to speak. 
10. (C) The subduction zone is the site of the destruction or consumption Of 
existing lithospheric material. In contrast, the mid-ocean ridge is the site Of 
the creation or emergence of new lithospheric material. 
Choice A is incorrect. Both mid-ocean ridges and subduction zones are 
boundaries between plates. 
Choice B is incorrect. Both are located on the ocean floor. 
Choice D is incorrect. It is unsupported by the passage. 
Choice E is incorrect. The reverse is true. 
11. (B) Choice B is correct. You are told that the new lithospheric material is 
injected into a mid-ocean ridge, a suboceanic mountain range. This new 
material does not disappear; it is added to the material already there. Thus, it 
is <i>incorporated</i> into the existing mid-ocean ridge. 
Choice A is incorrect. "In general the plates are in motion with respect to 
one another." Nothing suggests that they become immobilized; indeed, they 
are said to diverge from the ridge, sliding as they diverge. 
Choice C is incorrect. The specifically denies it. ("The size of the 
earth is essentially constant. 
Choice D is incorrect. It is the earth magnetic field reverses• 
Nothing in the passage suggests the new lithospheric material has any such 
potential. 
Choice E is incorrect. At a mid-ocean ridge, the site at which new lithos- 
pheric material is injected from below, the plates diverge; they do not sink. 
(They sink, one plate diving under another, at a subduction zone.)

12. (B) How did Semmelweiss save women from dying of childbed fever? He did 
so by establishing or <i>instituting</i> strict rules of hygiene. 
13. (B), (F) Given the ubiquity of light, it is <i>unsurprising</i> that creatures have 
<i>developed</i> the biologically helpful ability to make of light energy. 
Note the use of <i>therefore</i> indicating that the omitted portion of the sen- 
tence supports or continues a thought developed elsewhere in the sentence. 
14. (A), (E) Here the author is contrasting appropriate clerical behavior with 
inappropriate clerical behavior. The Austen brothers behave appropriately. 
they are properly <i>deferential</i> to their social superiors, paying them proper 
respect. The fictional Mr. Collins, however, behaves inappropriately. he is 
<i>sycophantic</i> (obsequious, fawning) to his social superiors. 
15. (B), (D) To <i>contest</i> an action is to dispute it or call it in question. The reclas- 
sification of Pluto did not go <i>uncontested</i>, for a large number of astronomers 
asked the International Astronomical Union to <i>reconsider</i> or rethink its deci- 
sion, calling the union's action in question. 
Note the use of <i>for</i>, indicating a relationship of cause and effect. 
16. (A), (F) The politicians are unwilling to <i>forsake</i> or abandon center stage. 
However, if they did leave center stage once in a while, the public might like 
them better for their <i>self</i>-effacement (withdrawal from attention). 
17. (D) The opening sentence describes the shattering of the Iroquois leadership's
pro-British policy. The remainder of the passage describes how Iroquois policy 
changed to reflect changes in European military goals. 
Choice A is incorrect. The passage is expository, not accusatory. 
Choice B is incorrect. Nothing in the passage suggests that such charges 
were made against the Iroquois. 
Choice C is incorrect. It is unsupported by the 
Choice E is incorrect. The passage demonstrates the Iroquois were able to 
play European power politics. 
Remember, when asked to find the main idea, be sure to check the opening 
and summary sentences of each paragraph. 
18. (E) Lines 23—34 indicate that in the early 1700s and through most of the 
eighteenth century the Iroquois <i>did</i> receive concessions from the European 
powers. Therefore, Choice E is the correct answer. 
Choice A is incorrect. The raid on Lachine was an effective response to 
French aggression, as was the Iroquois-enforced policy of aggressive neutrality. 
Choice B is incorrect. James II's overthrow was followed by colonial 
uprisings. 
Choice C is incorrect. In response to the Iroquois leaders' supposed favor- 
ing of the British, the French initiated attacks on the Iroquois (lines 7—13). 
Choice D is incorrect. This sums up the policy of aggressive neutrality. 
19. (A), (C) Choice A is supported by the passage: the opening sentence of the 
passage discuses a "recent assessment" Of the Status of global amphibian pop- 
ulations. Likewise, Choice C is supported by the passage: habit degradation, 
which negatively amphibians, can be caused by "the introduction of

exotic invasive species," that is, <i>non</i>-native species. Note that to receive credit 
for this question you must have chosen <i>both</i> correct answers, not just one. 
20. (B) The author cites or quotes <i>authority</i>. 
Choice A is incorrect. The author <i>defines</i> the term habit fragmentation. 
Choice C is incorrect. The author <i>states</i> a probability. He asserts, "Outright 
habitat loss <i>probably</i> has the greatest effect on amphibians. 
Choice D is incorrect. The author <i>qualifies</i> a statement. He first states, 
"Outright habitat loss probably has the greatest effect on amphibians." He 
then qualifies what he has said by stating that habitat degradation similarly 
amphibians. 
Choice E is incorrect. The author <i>makes</i> several assertions.
