          <p>First, read <b>only</b> the sentence. Find the clue (failed to secure the prestigious university's coveted diploma) and the pivot (despite). Write your own fill-in–here, <b><i>studying</i></b> would be a good choice. Now compare <b><i>studying</i></b> with every answer choice:</p>
          <p>studying</p>
          <p>A ✗<br />B ✗<br />C ✓<br />D ✗<br />E ~</p>
          <p>The answer is <b>(C)</b>. <b><i>Lucubration</i></b> means “intense study.”</p>

          <p>perseverant</p>
          <p>refractory</p>
          <p>playful</p>
          <p>indigent</p>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation" data-answer="C">
          <p>Okay, where’s that proof? To begin with, look for dramatic action or emotion. The blank describes something: “the student.” Did the student do or feel anything dramatic, or did anything dramatic happen to him?</p>
          <p>Yes. He apparently was “expelled” from a school. So “expelled” is at least part of the proof.</p>

          <p>Yes. “Less,” right before the blank. And “not,” right before “expelled.” So “less”<i> </i>and “not” are signals that each perform a reversal.</p>
          <p>So now you’ve got the proof. The sentence reads “less _______ … not expelled<i>.</i>” Those proof words force the blank to take on a very particular meaning.</p>
          <p>Think about what these words mean. If the student were <i>less</i> <u>such-and-such</u>, then he would <i>not</i> have been expelled.</p>
          <p>So being <u>such-and-such</u> actually got him expelled. In other words, the blank agrees with “expelled.” “Less” and “not” cancel each other out as negatives.</p>

          <p>Here are the choices again. One at a time, simplify the choices, then see how well your fill-in matches up. Mark down one of the following next to your “A B C D E”: Good (✓), Bad (✗), Sort Of (~), or Unknown (?).</p>
          <p>So now your paper might look like this:</p>
          <p>badly behaved</p>
          <p>A indefatigable = tireless ✗<br />
            B persevering = determined ✗<br />
            C refractory = ? ?<br />
            D playful ~<br />
            E indigent = poor ~</p>
          <p>The correct answer is in fact <b>(C)</b>, since <i>refractory</i> means “rebellious.” But even if you didn’t know what <i>refractory</i> means, you would have a good shot at getting this problem right through process of elimination. </p>

          <p>Your fill-in for #2 should probably be <b><i>heckling</i></b>. Remember to reuse the given language in the fill-in when you can.</p>
          <p>Now you can use that fill-in as another clue. There is no pivot between the two blanks, meaning that the two fill-ins agree in some way. The relationship seems to be causal: the opera performers are going to react to that heckling. A likely fill-in would be <b><i>upset by</i></b> or <b><i>afraid of</i></b>.</p>
          <p>Your paper might now look like this: afraid of…, heckling</p>

          <p>Here is an example of what a student might have written down for this question. This student wasn't sure about <b><i>tempered by</i></b>, and didn't know exactly about <b><i>lionizing</i></b> but felt that it wasn't quite right.</p>

          <p class="body-text">While this sentence has three blanks instead of two, and is made up of more than one sentence, your method is the same—start with the easiest blank. The easiest blank is often the one surrounded by the most text—that is, the one that is furthest from the other two blanks and thus has the most potential clues located near it. Here, the first blank seems promising:</p>
          <p class="blockquote">Perceptions of the (i) ________ role of intellectual practices within modern life underlie the familiar stereotypes of the educated as eggheads, ideologues, or worse.</p>
          <p class="body-text">The target is the <b><i>role</i></b>, and the role <b><i>underlies stereotypes</i></b> about eggheads “or worse.” So the word describing the role should be related to the idea of intellectual = egghead (a mild slang term roughly equivalent to “nerd”). Don't ignore the phrase <b><i>within modern life</i></b>. A good fill-in would be <b><i>irrelevant</i></b>. The sentence seems to be saying that people think intellectuals are eggheads because intellectual practices are not a helpful or important part of modern life.</p>
          <p class="body-text">The second sentence mirrors that idea (<b><i>These negative characterizations ..</i></b>.). It seems clear that the speaker is trying to defend academia. A good fill-in for the second blank would be <b><i>misunderstanding</i></b> or <b><i>twisting</i></b> (you can't really be sure if the people who think intellectuals are “eggheads” are getting it wrong deliberately or not).</p>
          <p class="body-text">Finally, you have a negative pivot: <b><i>unlikely</i></b> (and another one, <b><i>unless</i></b>). Work backwards on this sentence:</p>
          <p class="blockquote">If teachers DON'T address negative stereotypes directly…</p>
          <p class="blockquote">the stereotypes will continue</p>
          <p class="blockquote">so, the stereotypes are <b><i>unlikely to be</i></b> <b><i>eliminated</i></b> or <b><i>corrected</i></b></p>

          <p>seemingly unending string of divagations</p>
          <p>dubiously sanctified series of assignations</p>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation" data-answer="ADH">
          <p class="body-text">Attack the easiest blank first. That might be the last one, since you have the clues that the sermon's conclusion <b><i>devolved</i></b> into whatever goes in the blank, and that <b><i>the congregation began to fantasize about returning to the comfort of home</i></b>. Both clues tell you that you want a fill-in that means something like <b><i>bunch of stupid or boring stuff</i></b>.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Now that you have mentally completed the last sentence, it might help to paraphrase it before using the information to work backwards and analyze the rest of the sentence. Paraphrase: <b><i>It was only when the conclusion became stupid or boring that the people got bored</i></b>. The phrase <b><i>It was only when</i></b> serves as a pivot: before things got stupid or boring, they must have been pretty good, as you can verify from the clue <b><i>utterly enchanting</i></b>.</p>
          <p class="body-text">The second blank is pretty easy:…<b><i>his words possessed a _______ quality few could fail to find utterly enchanting</i></b>. That means that nearly everyone finds his words enchanting. In fact, you could recycle that word and put it in the blank—a good fill-in here would be <b><i>enchanting</i></b>.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Finally, the first blank. It's pretty hard to fill in this one without glancing at the answer choices, but at least try to figure out a general category of what you'll be looking for. There is a blank about the <b><i>subject</i></b>of the sermon, and then something nice about the words used in the sermon. Either these two things will go in the same direction or in an opposite direction.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Now try the choices (in any order you prefer).</p>
          <p class="body-text">In the first blank, <b><i>In spite of the insipid</i></b> makes sense—the meaning is <b><i>In spite of the bad quality of the topic, the words of the sermon were enchanting</i></b>. In the second option, <b><i>notwithstanding</i></b> is similar to <b><i>in spite of</i></b>, so you would expect something bad to come after, but <b><i>salubrious</i></b> means <b><i>healthy</i></b>. Since the third choice begins with <b><i>because</i></b>, you would expect something positive to come after it (<b><i>Because of some good quality of the sermon, the words were enchanting)</i></b>. But <b><i>inauspicious</i></b> means <b><i>likely to be unsuccessful</i></b>. Only <b><i>In spite of the insipid</i></b> works.</p>
          <p class="body-text">In the second blank, only <b><i>euphonious</i></b> works. The root <b><i>eu</i></b> means <b><i>good</i></b>, but that's not too helpful here, since all three words use that root. However, <b><i>euphemistic</i></b> (substituting inoffensive words in for more explicit or hurtful ones) doesn't make sense, and <b><i>eulogistic</i></b> (full of praise, especially for a deceased person) also doesn't match the idea of <b><i>enchanting</i></b>.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Finally, the only phrase that means anything like <b><i>stupid/boring stuff</i></b> is <b><i>seemingly unending string of divagations</i></b> (<b><i>divagations</i></b> are tangents, or instances of going off-topic). <b><i>Prevarications</i></b> are falsehoods, and <b><i>assignations</i></b> are romantic meetups.</p>
          <p class="body-text">The answer is <b>In spite of the insipid</b>, <b>euphonious</b>, and <b>seemingly unending string of divagations</b>.</p>
        </div>

        </div>
        <div class="explanation" data-answer="BD">
          <p class="body-text">Most would agree that the second blank is easier. The clue is <b><i>the precise moment…certainly not be registered</i></b>, and the lack of a pivot tells you that the fill-in agrees with the clue. So you might fill in something like <b><i>without registering</i></b> (again, recycling language from the sentence itself).</p>
          <p class="body-text">Turning to the first blank, you can see that the <b><i>without registering</i></b> fill-in lines up with <b><i>intangibility</i></b>, while the first blank lines up with “point of no return.” So you might fill in <b><i>no return</i></b> for the first blank.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Now you match to the answer choices. Only <b><i>indiscernibly</i></b> fits <b><i>without registering</i></b>. Only <b><i>irrevocability</i></b> fits <b><i>no return. Irrevocability</i></b> and <b><i>indiscernibly</i></b> are the correct responses.</p>

        <div class="explanation" data-answer="D">
          <p class="body-text">It was probably pretty easy for you to identify the clues (<b><i>nettled, jocularity, preferred</i></b>) and to see that Marie is against <b><i>jocularity</i></b>, or joking behavior. A fill-in might be <b><i>serious</i></b>.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Now, imagine that you go through the answer choices. <b><i>Miserable</i></b> and <b><i>indignant</i></b> both “sort of” match, but they both seem a little off, too. Just because Marie doesn't like her sister's constant joking, that doesn't mean she's <b><i>miserable</i></b> or <b><i>indignant</i></b> in her outlook on life. Perhaps you don't remember what <b><i>waggish</i></b> or <b><i>staid</i></b> mean, and you don't totally remember <b><i>sycophantic</i></b> either, but you're sure it doesn't mean <b><i>serious</i></b>.</p>
          <p class="body-text">So your paper might look like this:</p>
          <p class="blockquote">serious<br />A ~<br />B ~<br />C ?<br />D ?<br />E </p>
          <p class="body-text">You can now identify another trap. You don't like <b><i>miserable</i></b> or <b><i>indignant</i></b>, but you don't know the other words, so you find yourself reluctant to choose (C) or (D). Unfortunately, you're falling into a trap…</p>
          <p class="body-text">The <b><i>Close But Not Close Enough Trap</i></b> occurs when a wrong answer choice is “in the ballpark” but something is off in the meaning—however, the word is familiar, so it's attractive.</p>
          <p class="body-text">You might be afraid to pick a word you don't know. Overcome this fear. As it turns out, the correct answer is <b><i>staid</i></b>, which means “serious, sedate by temperament or habits.”</p>

          <p>The blank is about Dr. Spicer. A key signal is the word “Unlike,” which sets up a comparison between “the more genial researchers” and “the ________ Dr. Spicer.” </p>
          <p>The rules of a comparison tell you that the blank should be something that means “<i>less </i>genial,” in contrast to the “<i>more </i>genial” folks. </p>
          <p>Your fill-in could actually be <i>less genial</i>. If it was, you get the gold star for recycling sentence material. That’s the safest habit to adopt for both Sentence Equivalence and Text Completion. Once you get comfortable recycling the proof right into your fill-in, you’ll find the process both easier to carry out (it’s <i>less work</i> than coming up with new words!) and more effective. With recycled material in your fill-in, you’ll be much less likely to infect that fill-in with the virus of any new, unsupported idea.</p>
          <p>It’s okay, though, to put down <i>less friendly</i>, simplifying from “genial” a bit. You can even write something decidedly negative like <i>unfriendly</i>.</p>
          <p>The answer is <b>standoffish</b> and <b>glacial</b>. Both words can mean “emotionally cold and distant.” (<i>Glacial</i> can also mean “slow, physically cold, or pertaining to glaciers.”) Both are a good enough match to <i>less genial</i> to be the winners.</p>
          <p>Rounding out the vocab lesson, <i>sedulous</i> and <i>assiduous</i> mean “hardworking or persistent.” <i>Baneful</i> means “harmful,” and <i>partisan</i> means “biased, in favor of only one’s own side or party.”</p>

          <p>Look for the proof. The blank describes the new guest, who “refused to reveal” things about himself. If there were a word meaning “not self-revealing,” you’d pick it. The word needs to be something like <i>secretive</i> or <i>mysterious.</i></p>
          <p>As it turns out, <b>mysterious</b> and <b>inscrutable </b>are the correct answers. <i>Inscrutable</i> means “not able to be scrutinized” and often indicates hiding emotions. It’s not exactly the same thing as <i>mysterious</i>, but there’s a substantial overlap in their meanings. </p>
          <p>You’ve discovered that most correct answer pairs are at least as closely related as these two. For the purposes of this book, call them <i>near-synonyms</i>.</p>

          <p>It may be true that everyone likes flattery, but a good manager is not unduly persuaded by it, and thus not taken in by _____________, who use wheedling and fawning to get ahead.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="explanation" data-answer="AD">
          <p>Go straight to the words and attempt to make pairs: <i>toadies</i> and <i>lackeys</i> are subordinates who follow without question. <i>Tyros</i> and <i>novices</i> are both beginners. <i>A</i><i>esthetes</i> love or study beauty, and <i>anchorites</i> are recluses, especially religious hermits, and thus those two words are not related.</p>
          <p>Therefore, the answer must be <i>toadies/lackeys</i> or <i>tyros/novices</i>. The only question you need to ask at this point is, “Does the sentence call for a <i>suck-up</i> or a <i>beginner</i>?” </p>
          <p>There is a lot of proof (such as “flattery” and “wheedling and fawning”) that the question is calling for <b>toadies </b>and <b>lackeys</b>.</p>

          <p>“Education advocates” are certainly in favor of learning; your fill-in might be something like <i>helpful.</i></p>
          <p>Looking at the choices, <i>conducive</i>, <i>appropriate</i>, and <i>beneficial</i> all seem to be matches.</p>
          <p>However, if you place each word into the sentence, one choice creates an incorrect idiom. “Conducive <i>to</i>” and “beneficial <i>to</i>” work, but “appropriate <i>to</i>” is not a correct idiom—instead, you would say “appropriate <i>for</i> learning.”</p>

          <p>The target is “he” and the clue is “grandstanding and deploying his formidable lexicon for oratorical effect.” That is, he speaks in a pompous way, as though showing off his vocabulary for an audience.</p>
          <p>The word <i>florid</i> seems appropriate—it means “flowery” and often applies to words, as in <i>florid poetry</i>. But wait! <i>Florid</i><b> </b>applies to writing, speech, decor, etc.—not the people who produce those things! (Actually, you can apply <i>florid</i> to people, but in that context it means “flushed, ruddy,” as in having rosy cheeks, which is not appropriate here.)</p>
          <p>The answer is <b>declamatory </b>and <b>grandiloquent</b>, both of which describe pompous orators (that is, people who make speeches) or the speech of such people.</p>
          <p>Memorizing that <i>florid</i> means “flowery” is better than nothing, but doesn’t really tell you what kinds of things to describe with that word or how to use it metaphorically. Once again, it is important to learn words in context.</p>
